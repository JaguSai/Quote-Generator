# Quote-Generator

The goal of this project is how to make an asynchronous fetch request to a rest API in order to get our quotes.

We have added the background effect from Hero Patterns website. Thereâ€™s many to choose from so that will allow you to make it look unique.

We have two buttons, the first is a new quote button and the other button we have is a twitter button.

When we click new quote button, it generates new quotes and when we click on twitter button it will open twitter in a new tab. 

If we were logged in, it will allow us to tweet using this button.

This project is also mobile responsive as well.

Make any styling changes you would like Of course, all of the code is there and nothing is hidden from you so if you would like to make any other styling changes, feel free!

Have fun building!
